# Changelog

All notable changes to rAPIdtools are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with the usual 0.x caveat that
minor releases may change public APIs.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- **Loading models and running analysis.** Use `rapidtools.models.load(provider, ...)`
  to get a model wrapper by its registry key, then hand it to `AssetAnalyzer(model, prompt, ...)`.
  This replaces the old per-provider analyzer classes. To see what's available without 
  importing PyTorch, call `list_providers()` or `catalog()` , or look at the `PROVIDERS` registry directly.
  `GenerationConfig` carries per-call options such as `json_mode` and `temperature`; 
  `RateLimitPolicy` gives hosted models a shared cooldown and retry passes so
  rate limits do not leave holes in the results.
- **New model backends:** OpenAI, Meta Muse Spark and Alibaba Qwen APIs; Meta
  Muse Glimmer, Qwen VL and any Hugging Face vision-language checkpoint
  (`HFVisionInference`) locally, with optional 4-bit loading. Every wrapper
  exposes `list_known_models()` and, where the provider supports it,
  `list_available_models(api_key)`.
- **Keyless Google imagery:** `GoogleAerialImageExtractor` and
  `GoogleOrthomosaicExtractor` stitch satellite tiles for polygons or regions,
  and `GoogleStreetViewImageExtractor` finds the nearest Street View panorama
  for each asset, crops the field of view covering the footprint and can save
  the decoded depth map. No API key or billing account required.
- **Graphical interface.** `rapidtools-gui` (or `python -m rapidtools.gui`)
  opens a local web app that loads imagery, detects assets with SAM 3, runs any
  supported model with a custom prompt, and explores the results on the image.
  It can be shared on a network with a token and driven headlessly through
  `AssetAnalysisWorkflow`.
- **Cooperative cancellation.** Every long-running component and the
  `Pipeline` accept a `cancel_event` and raise `OperationCancelled` at the next
  asset, tile or batch, keeping partial results.
- **Configurable asset outlines** in `AerialImageryExtractor`: `outline_shape`
  (`geometry`, `bbox`, `rotated_bbox`, `convex_hull`, `corners`),
  `outline_buffer` in pixels, percent or real-world units, `outline_width` in
  pixels or percent of the image, and `outline_color`.
- **Edge handling** in `AerialImageryExtractor`: `min_footprint_coverage` keeps
  assets whose footprint is only partly imaged and `pad_edges` pads their
  crops to full size. Coverage is judged from the raster mask, so alpha bands
  and internal masks count.
- `SAM3OrthoFeatureExtractor(merge_overlaps=False)` keeps one asset per
  detected instance with its confidence, for countable objects such as
  vehicles.
- `BoundingBox.from_raster()` and `BoundingBox.from_geojson()` build regions
  from a raster's extent or a GeoJSON file.
- `PhysicalAssetCollection.from_shapefile()` / `to_shapefile()`.
- `rapidtools.login()` and `ensure_huggingface_login()` authenticate with the
  Hugging Face Hub for gated weights; local wrappers call them automatically.
- `rapidtools.configure_logging()` for opt-in progress output; importing the
  package no longer touches logging configuration.
- Pipeline steps declare a `Stage`, so steps can be added in any order.
- Documentation site built with Sphinx and the Book theme: user guide, worked
  examples on the 2025 Eaton Fire dataset, GUI guide and a per-class API
  reference. Published through GitHub Pages.
- A test suite covering the core objects, data sources, models, processing
  components and the GUI, run on Linux, macOS and Windows for Python 3.11 to
  3.13.

### Changed

- `import rapidtools` is side-effect free and takes about two seconds; model
  and processing classes, and the `models`, `processing` and `gui`
  subpackages, load on first use.
- Constructor parameter names were harmonized across components
  (`save_directory`, `buffer_m`, `max_images_per_asset`, ...). Old names still
  work and emit a `DeprecationWarning`.
- `AerialImageryExtractor` accepts a folder or list of rasters and opens each
  raster once.
- `MapillaryImageExtractor` culls occluded views by ray casting against
  neighbouring footprints and can check Mapillary's semantic labels before
  downloading (`strict_content_filter`, `MapillaryLabelMapper`).
- `BuildingRegularizer` runs a second, lower-threshold pass on dropped assets
  to rescue shadowed buildings.
- Local model wrappers use dynamic batching, precision chosen for the
  hardware, and release GPU memory between batches.

### Deprecated

- The provider-specific analyzers (`GeminiAssetAnalyzer`,
  `ClaudeAssetAnalyzer`, `OpenAIAssetAnalyzer`, `MuseSparkAssetAnalyzer`,
  `QwenAssetAnalyzer`, `Gemma4AssetAnalyzer`, `LlamaVisionAssetAnalyzer`,
  `MuseGlimmerAssetAnalyzer`, `QwenVisionAssetAnalyzer`,
  `HFVisionAssetAnalyzer`). Use `AssetAnalyzer(load(provider, ...))`.
- Deprecated keyword aliases listed above.

### Fixed

- `rapidtools.models` and `rapidtools.processing` are reachable as attributes
  of the top-level package, as the README examples show.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-12

- Transformers syntax updated to the latest release.
- Bounding boxes can be extracted from a GeoJSON file.
- Post-disaster asset detection bug fixed.
- Generalized asset inference example added.
